In fact, I should have been on the way to the airport to pick her up as I write this. Except that Victoria got 30cm of snow overnight and that basically shut the city down.</p><p>30cm of snow on the UVic campus. Not something Victoria is set up to deal with. The issue wasn’t so much with the airport or the flight. It actually departed four hours late and to a different city for a stopover (Calgary) for some reason. The problem was that it was impossible to get to the airport because the transit system was shut down and there were no cabs out on the roads either.</p><p>We tried this morning to arrange for a ride, to get a cab or to otherwise find a way to get to the airport, but by the original flight time, it was clear that getting to the airport was not possible.</p><h3 id="to-the-phone">To the Phone!</h3><p>We got on the phone with Air Canada to see what the options were and needless to say, with large numbers of flights in both Victoria and Vancouver cancelled, some time was going to be spent on hold. I actually had lunch with some work friends and took the train back home before a human picked up.</p><p>In the meantime, I started looking at various other flights tomorrow and beyond to see if we could spend our way out of the situation. I was watching as seats were booked and prices rose and options went from ridiculously expensive to completely unaffordable.</p><p>Victoria is not a big city and the airport doesn’t see many flights a day. There is just one non-stop to Toronto and then a bunch of flights between various cities in BC. Flights were very limited as most everything was already booked thanks to the Christmas holidays coming up. We considered whether the ferry or even a float plane to Vancouver to fly from there was an option. Since Vancouver airport was also slammed, there were few options there either.</p><p>I eventually booked a very expensive flight on Friday with Air Canada (fully refundable) and hoped that the original flight would be cancelled so we could get some of our money back. Happily, we eventually got an Air Canada customer service person on the phone after well over two hours of waiting and she was able to cancel our original booking (even though the flight wasn’t cancelled), take over the seat I had booked (and refunded us for that flight).</p><h3 id="hashtag-winning">Hashtag Winning</h3><p>The net result of all this is that we have a flight booked for Friday morning and the change was made without charge to us. That’s pretty decent considering the original booking was a “basic” fare with no refunds or changes and that flight wasn’t cancelled.</p><p>I also booked a fully refundable ticket for the Saturday flight just in case. The weather in Toronto isn’t looking great for Thursday or Friday and the last thing we need is for the Friday flight to get cancelled and have zero options to get the kid home before Christmas.</p><h3 id="calm-and-collected">Calm and Collected</h3><p>The biggest lesson I’ve learned in my many years of dealing with messy situations like this is to be patient. It’s really easy to get super frustrated and to take it out on the people who are trying to help you. If you keep a level head, it often works out far better than trying to yell your way out of a bad situation.</p><p>The people at Air Canada (or WestJet or any other airline) are trying their best and really want to get you to where you are trying to go. Working with them and being flexible will often result in a good outcome. In our case, we explained our situation, said we had booked a new refundable fare on Friday and asked what our options were for the ticket we had.</p><p>The customer service person was excellent and spent fifteen minutes with us on the phone moving things around, re-booking seats, cancelling check-ins and fixed us up. I’m willing to bet that had we gone into that call demanding to fly home ASAP that we wouldn’t have been blessed with the same outcome.</p><p>Remember that the companies you deal with are made up of humans who don’t need to be treated as anything less than a human. Things happen. Snow falls, planes break down and not everything can go as planned 100% of the time.</p><p>Pack your patience and treat people the way you would want to be treated if you were the unfortunate one on the other end of the phone line and you’ll see that things will often work out.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 28, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/authors/james-koole/" rel="author">James Koole</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/vivaldi/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Vivaldi</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/an-epic-cross-canada-journey/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> An Epic Cross-Canada Journey </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
