I re-created it in March, 2022 when the drama with Elon and Twitter started. When I quit Twitter late in the fall, I decided to move to a smaller instance for a variety of reasons.</p><p>That instance was <a href="https://indieweb.social">indieweb.social</a> and I opted for that instance because I liked the community there which seemed aligned with my thoughts on the open web. The local feed was one of the best parts of being on that instance for first little while. It was not exclusively about open/indieweb topics, but it sure leaned that way.</p><p>But as the instance grew, the indieweb part seemed to fade quite a bit. And I wasn’t helping either. My posts tended to be more about running than indieweb stuff which left me wondering if I belonged there. The value of the local feed was diminishing a bit for me and I started considering a move either to a new instance or back to mastodon.social.</p><p>I thought about going to <a href="https://mstdn.ca">mstdn.ca</a> (the “Canadian” instance) and also about going to the corporate instance my employer runs. But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made to head to <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>.</p><p>Earlier today I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jameskoole">made the switch back</a> with the migration tool and redirect feature that Mastodon offers. It all worked pretty nicely, although I had to manually recreate some filters. My old profile on indieweb.social is redirecting and I set it to delete posts over 6 months old so by the summer it’ll be blank and I can probably just delete it.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 28, 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/tags/open-web/">Open Web</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/authors/james-koole/" class="invert" rel="author">James Koole</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>&copy; Massively</li><li>Design: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML5 UP</a></li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
