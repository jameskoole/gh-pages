I re-created it in March, 2022 when the drama with Elon and Twitter started. When I quit Twitter late in the fall, I decided to move to a smaller instance for a variety of reasons.</p><p>That instance was <a href="https://indieweb.social">indieweb.social</a> and I opted for that instance because I liked the community there which seemed aligned with my thoughts on the open web. The local feed was one of the best parts of being on that instance for first little while. It was not exclusively about open/indieweb topics, but it sure leaned that way.</p><p>But as the instance grew, the indieweb part seemed to fade quite a bit. And I wasn’t helping either. My posts tended to be more about running than indieweb stuff which left me wondering if I belonged there. The value of the local feed was diminishing a bit for me and I started considering a move either to a new instance or back to mastodon.social.</p><p>I thought about going to <a href="https://mstdn.ca">mstdn.ca</a> (the “Canadian” instance) and also about going to the corporate instance my employer runs. But the more I thought about it, the more sense it made to head to <a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>.</p><p>Earlier today I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jameskoole">made the switch back</a> with the migration tool and redirect feature that Mastodon offers. It all worked pretty nicely, although I had to manually recreate some filters. My old profile on indieweb.social is redirecting and I set it to delete posts over 6 months old so by the summer it’ll be blank and I can probably just delete it.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 28, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/tags/open-web/">Open Web</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/authors/james-koole/" rel="author">James Koole</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/thanks-elon/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Thanks Elon!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://www.jameskoole.com/day-trips-to-run/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Day Trips to Run  </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.jameskoole.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
